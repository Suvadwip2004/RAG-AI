Like it with high energy because in this video, I am going to take you from zero and make you a profitable web developer. This course will be modern because web development has changed over time. A lot of new things have come. A lot of things have come in JavaScript which makes the work very easy. A lot of technologies have come which will make your work very easy. This course will be for those who don't know anything. You know that it is zero for you if you know about web development. We will start from zero but we will raise the bar like anything. What will we learn in this course? I will tell you in a few days. Web development is a very profitable thing. I have personally earned a lot of money through web development. And I believe that you can also be very successful by learning web development. During the course, you will get notes, cheat sheets, references, all these things. This course is going to be a little different because in this course, I will tell you the technologies that you should learn as much as possible according to your experience. And I will make this course a complete course with all the web development technologies. There will be course content, complete web development, front end, back end, database. I will teach you as much as you want to learn. I will tell you the course content in a few days. But you guys keep in mind that you will be a full stack developer. In the future, you will be given a lot of projects during the course. And in the end of the course, we will make some good projects so that you can be very strong on web development. According to me, project based learning is the best way to learn. So I will make you a lot of projects. And if you agree, then write it in the comment section below. I agree because when you comment, my face gets a smile. So do comment. I want to make you believe that after finishing this course, you can make any kind of website from the beginning to the end. And during this course, I will make you a lot of websites so that your confidence will go up a lot. So let's start with the first video of our Sigma web development course. Let's roll the intro. I have come to my computer screen. And now as I am doing, you guys follow me. I have downloaded Google Chrome browser here. You also download Google Chrome browser. I am not saying that it won't work. But you guys have to do exactly what I am doing here. So here we will follow you as I am doing. And along with that, you will be able to follow the videos as you come. I will go to Google and I will write down the download VS Code. Now what is VS Code? VS Code is a source code editor. If you are in Windows, then I will click on Windows. If you are in Mac, Linux or any other operating system, then you can download it for that strange operating system. And the process is exactly the same. You can see that my downloads folder is here. And as you can see here, this setup is already downloaded. I will refresh it here. And here, you can double click on VS Code's setup and install it. So simply, you have to install VS Code. Install the game is as easy as it is. You can quickly agree here. This lies in the slide. There are damages. And after that, I will accept the agreement. I will accept it. You also read it like me. And I am the fastest reader in the world. Next, next. It is important to check both the icons here. Check both the icons. It is very important to check. If you want a desktop shortcut, then you can create a desktop icon. And after that, you can install it. If your PC is fast like mine, then it will be fast. But if your PC is slow, then there is no problem. If you have a problem, then you can install it. If you have a problem, then there is no problem. Install it slowly. There will be nothing more. I will recommend you to subscribe to the channel. Because I want you to follow these videos. Like I have shown in the video. You will get a notification. So if you want to follow this course completely, ideally you should subscribe. With that said, our VS Code is downloaded. I have opened VS Code. Don't be afraid of this. And I am saying this again. If you know things already, we are starting with beginner friendly. But we will raise the bar like anything in the upcoming videos. So stay tuned. I will also request you to tell me in the comments section what is your level? Are you a beginner, advanced or intermediate user? In the comments section, tell me where does web development come from? Beginner, advanced, intermediate. Please do comment this. Now what is VS Code? If you don't know what is VS Code, then let me tell you that there is a code editor. Which helps you to edit code. Now you can say that I can edit the code in the notepad. So yes, do it in the notepad. It will be done in that too. Yes, I am not doing it in the sarcastic way. Let's set up this here. And let me show you what is in it. Which makes it a little different from the notepad. Let's set up this here. I will not do the color themes here. In fact, I will do it. I will keep the theme dark here. And I have done all this. Next section, you can close the welcome too. But here I am telling you some tips. That's it. The VS Code is here. It has started. You can see this VS Code screen. You can make a new file here. But I will recommend you to close it. Yes, you close it. Why did you close it? I am going to make a new folder here. And I will name it. You guessed it right. Of course. We will do everything in this course. We will do everything. We will do everything related to the course. You will shift here. If there is an app in Windows. You can see an option called open with code. This option is called open with code. You can open this particular folder. It helps you in opening the VS Code. You will select it. Now what you will do here? You will say yes, I trust this file. Click on this and say yes, I trust the authors. And this folder is open now. If I click on plus, it is to make a new file. I have written index.html. If you don't know what I am writing. Write it. Enter it. And then I will write Hey, I am your first HTML file. I have written this. You can see the bindu here. This is the white color. This is the bindu. You haven't saved this file. Save it by doing it. I will recommend you to go to the file and enable the auto save option. As you type it, you won't see the bindu. Your file will instantly save. You will type it. I will recommend this. We won't use control s. Otherwise, if you want to save it, you can disable this option. I will want you to click on gear. Click on settings. And search here mouse. Mouse. Now you can see editor mouse wheel zoom. You can check it. I will tell you what will happen if you check it. Just close it. You don't have to be scared. What is VS code? Why is VS code? What is this? You don't have to see it. You will simply scroll it. Your font size changes. I will show you a magic. It is very simple logic. In downloads, there is a sigma web development course in the folder. In this file, you will see the index.html. It is very natural. I have opened this folder in VS code. I have opened this folder in VS code. This file is also made here. I will make another file here. I will make this.txt. I will write this is this. This file will also be made here. This folder and this VS code are in sync. This folder and this VS code are in sync. I will open this file from here. I will show you. This is my file. I can do that too. But I will not use the notepad. There are some things in VS code that don't give me notepad. And I want to get those features. I don't want to overrun you. But I will show you. What is this in VS code that you don't get in notepad? If I write here. If I enter. It automatically gives me the opening and closing tag. If I mark the exclamation mark here. It gives me a boilerplate template. I will click on it. The basic code of HTML is here. We will talk about it later. Don't overrun it. But I want to tell you. What is this in the VS code? Why didn't we use notepad? And this feels. The feeling of the developer. The hacker. That feel is also important. Then there will be a convenience to do coding. For Mac and Linux users. I want to comment here. Exactly similar things are going to happen for you. I am using windows. I am using windows laptop. I can't use it in 3 laptops. Linux Mac and Windows 3. I can't use it together. Exactly same things will be for you. In fact, I should say similar things. Exactly same things will be very similar. You will be able to follow along very easily. Don't worry. I will tell you about some extensions. You will enjoy it. You will also say. What did you recommend? But I will tell you in a while. This is criminally underrated. I am telling you that you will enjoy it. I want to tell you that too. You will right click on command palette. There are many options for the VS code. You don't need to know all these options. As we will move forward in the course. The features that will come in use. As I will tell you. And you can use it. But what I will do here. I will toggle the screencast mode. You don't have to do this. But I will do it. So you will know. I clicked. I will type any type. If I press caps lock. You will know when I pressed. This is not relevant for you. But I just want to tell you. Screencast mode. Screencast mode. We can change the settings from here. Here you see the vertical offset of screencast mode. What does vertical offset mean? If I set the vertical offset to 0. It came up. If I set the vertical offset to 70. It came down. I will set it to 60. If I set the vertical offset to 80. It came up. From bottom. It will show how much it will show. I have set it to 0. I will type any type. It will show you down. I will close the settings tab. This is tab. You have tabs in chrome. Exactly. I hope you have understood. What is it? I forgot about it. I will tell you exactly what it is. You can also close the page of VS Code. If you want to zoom in VS Code. I will do it. I am recording video. Add control plus. I have shown you. I am doing it because I am recording videos. Ideally I want you to see the screen from the past. But when I am doing my coding. I don't zoom in that much. I will keep it in mind. These are related to VS Code. I want to tell you how websites work. A website basically. Works through 3 types of people. Imagine 3 people. One is Client. One is Server. Who is Client? Second one is Server. Third one is Browser. Who is also called as Babu. Browser. What is Client? What is Server? I am Client. You are all who use a browser. Who is Browser? This is Chrome. I am Client. I will tell you from Client. When I write codewithherry.com I write code with herry.com I tell this browser. To give me code with herry.com website. Or if I write here. YouTube.com I tell YouTube.com website. I tell this browser. Give me youtube.com I want to watch YouTube. Browser says you want YouTube. Take this. I will enter youtube.com So I will take youtube.com from server. I will take youtube.com from server. Do you understand? From server.com I will pass it to youtube.com and show this screen. It worked so fast. Internet.com is fast. It is fast. It is so less. But still. It is fast according to my locality. With this fast internet speed. It is fast. So Client server sends a request. Through browser. Browser is my assistant. I will do the same with browser. To help me. To get this web page from server. Who is managing server? YouTube.com And there is a code in that server. Which sends me this kind of code. When I write youtube.com This code came. How to convert this code? This is for browser. How to show me this? So Client browser says Give me youtube.com Browser says you want youtube.com I will ask youtube.com Then browser goes to server. Means it sends a request to server. It says give me youtube.com It will give server here. It will not say here. It will say error. It will say server error. Whatever the response is. Ideally it should be 200. With that response. Which is our browser. It comes back to client. And shows this kind of page. I hope you have cleared. Client browser. To server. This is how it works. I will tell you once more. When you write google.com So client. Browser says give me google.com Browser says you want google.com Wait I will give you server. So browser goes to server. And it takes google.com. And it gives you google.com. Along with google.com. All the images, videos. All the things are sent. These icons are sent. These icons have a URL in this code. And that too is the browser. We display it correctly. The server sends the browser a bundle. This kind of bundle. Passing this bundle. This is the browser. Now whatever interaction the user will do. With this page the browser will get additional request. If I write and inspect. And then I go to network. And here I write. I wrote Harry. So many requests have been sent for images. And many more requests have been sent. So you will interact. And you will have to send additional request to the browser. So by combining the tools. Consider it as a restaurant. You have given an order. Like you have given an order. A waiter took your order. And then went to the kitchen. He sent your order to the kitchen. Consider the kitchen as a server. And finally when the kitchen gave the order. So what did this waiter do? The browser is doing. The waiter saw you. Maybe he couldn't make the order in the kitchen. For some reason. It is very less that you order something. And you didn't get it. But it happens sometimes. Like here also sometimes. You get the error. Or 500 error. The server is not working. So this kind of error is always given. But ideally 200. And you get this kind of web page. So you can consider it as a restaurant. So whenever you write. You can find the code with the error. And if you write. Code with the error. If you have the error. You can find the code with the error. Or if you have the error. You can find the code with the error. So whatever server you send. So this cycle goes on. The client sends the request. The browser sends the server. The server sends the request. After that the server sends the data from the browser. And whatever data sends. The server sends the same request. The server sends something. Whatever data the server sends. The client returns the browser. And so on. So now you will understand. What is backend? What is backend? Backend is how the server is processing the request. If you have a blog. There is a lot of data in the blog. So what will you do? Will you store the web page separately? Or will you generate the content dynamically? I will take an example of Google. If I search Harry by. You can see the Google header. These are the links. This format doesn't change at all. If I write here. Shubham. I have written Shubham here. So I will write Shubham here. Now see. When I wrote Harry by. I am showing a similar content of it. So what does Google do? The backend of the Google server. So that it can send such HTML for corresponding query. So when I write Shubham. When I write Harry. So send this. So the process of generating this. Through which system is happening? It is the backend. Now this backend can be Jango. This backend can be Flask. This backend can be Node. This backend can be PHP. This backend can be Ruby on Rails. And the data in the backend. The backend code is not visible to the client. The front end code is sent to the server. And how did the server make this code? We don't know. Because it is running on the server. If you are confused. You will understand everything. Now we will see the backend. Now we understand how the front end works. The front end is primarily made with three languages. HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These three languages. If you are making a website. Every website needs HTML, CSS, In most of the cases. If you use only HTML. Then it is a basic skeleton. It is made of web site. After that when you use CSS. You can style it. This button looks like this. It is just the change of CSS. Along with that, this button is red. This button looks like this. This is all the help of CSS. You can see the edges. This is all the help of CSS. The work of CSS is to style the page. What color, what will be the color of the page. All these works are done through CSS. There is a beauty of CSS. The HTML page. HTML is the base of any page. This is a standard. If you make any website. You will make it on HTML. So that the browser can understand. How to parse. The browser works. And HTML is a skeleton. This is a standard. Anyone who makes a website. You can use the same HTML. This is a standard. This is a standard. So that everyone can make the same pages. And if someone is making the browser. Then you have to parse the same language. If you have learnt 80% HTML. Then you are good to go for web development. Now there are some things directly from HTML. For example, if I write a lot of HTML codes. So I am writing some HTML codes. I have used the emitter abbreviation. I have used the exclamation mark. I have used the exclamation mark. I have written the code. I will write this is HTML. And I can open this HTML file directly. I can open this HTML file directly. And as soon as I open this HTML file. As soon as I open this HTML file. You see this will open like this. I can open it directly. Actually double click here. And it opened. This is not styled. This HTML file is very basic. You can run videos directly from HTML. You can run videos directly from HTML. I will show you how to run videos. I will change the HTML file. I will show you how to run videos. I will show you how to run videos. There is a video tag in HTML. If you enter the video. Then the video you will put in the src will be played. If I put video1.mp4 here. You see the video1.mp4 is automatically shown. This is the benefit of using the video1.mp4. This is the benefit of using the video1.mp4. You see here. I will reload it. This video is automatically shown. For that I will have to write controls here. And I will refresh it. So I will have the controls to play. I can play. This is a permission. For selling. A person needs it. How much money does he need? 130 crores. Final. Now if I put video2.mp4 here. I have put video1 here. I have two more videos. I have some more videos here. If I put video2.mp4 here. Then video2 will be shown. I will reload it. If you have put the video. Then you can help me and show the people. What do you say? This was the look of Ben Stokes. Now if I do video3 here. Suppose I do video3 here. Then my third video will be played. So I will reload it. And you see I can play it. This is the third video. I have run the third video. I have run the third video. I will close it. And we can run video4 too. And I have video4. I have a DJ video. So you see. You can make such things. You can use only html. You don't need to do anything else. You can play videos with only html. You can display images. You can play videos with only html. If you want to style it. Suppose I want a border. Or a red background. Then what I have to do for that. I have to use CSS. CSS adds beauty to any website. Then comes JavaScript. Which adds interaction to a website. For example. What will happen when I click on search. What will happen when I write code with html. Like code with htr is written. And here auto complete. Why did it come? Because there was a request on the server. And for this query. The results of auto complete came here. So all these things happen with JavaScript. This is called client side scripting. I mean. If we want to do scripting in client. If we want to do coding. We can do it on the client side. With the help of JavaScript. This is our website. I am talking about beauty with brain. CSS adds beauty. And brain came from JavaScript. Now JavaScript. Helps you to make the page dynamic. For example. If you want to change the content. Then all this is done with JavaScript. There are a lot of mosquitoes here. So I will kill these mosquitoes. They are not getting anything from here. My racket is working. Oh my God. Like the video. When I was in college. I was shocked. First learn 100% HTML. Learn 100% CSS. Until you remember all the properties. But this expression is wrong. Why is it wrong? Because HTML is 80%. And CSS is 40% 60%. And JavaScript. You can learn 50-70%. You can start web development. You can make projects. You can move ahead. I will tell you about the impact of chat GPT and web development. I will tell you about the impact of chat GPT and web development. I will tell you about it. You can stay tuned. So don't run after perfection. Don't think about it. I will do HTML for a year. I will do CSS for a year. I will make projects in 4 years. Don't think about it. Do HTML. And CSS 40-60%. And JavaScript. You can learn 50-70%. You can make a website. You will learn more HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You will not know. You must have perfected your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While you are making money. And working as a professional web developer. You will be earning with learning. And you will be improving your skills. You will be earning with learning. Don't think about it. I will remember all the HTML tags. I will make a website. I will remember all the CSS properties. I will teach you so much. I will teach you so much. You will learn what matters. I don't want you to learn for years. That's why I designed this course. So that you can learn only what matters. You will learn from practice. And I will make you do it in the same course. Here we have 2-4 mosquitoes to learn about the Sigma web development course. Which is good. Our audience is increasing. In this course, we will learn HTML first. Then CSS, then JavaScript. I will tell you about the tricks in this course. Which you will not have heard. I have learned different points about my career. I will tell you about it in this course. I have learned some great tricks in my career. I have learned a lot in my career. I want you to learn all the tricks from the start. I want you to learn all the tricks from the start. If you have any doubts in the course. Then you can use the hashtag doubt.

That will bring a smile on my face. Now what is this react? Next is what is Angular? These are the front end frameworks. They help you to use JavaScript. That is HTML, CSS, JavaScript are websites. They help you to make this process faster. How? We will learn this in this course. Yes, we will learn in this course. We will learn in this course. I told you that I will make this course completely different. I will make you to take you from zero to hero in web development. I will take you to hero in web development. Take your seat's belly. Because you have taken the ticket of Sigma Web Development Express. I want to give you a very good analogy. To teach HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is HTML, it is just like car skeleton. If you paint CSS in it. And if you put it in internal engine car. Then it is JavaScript. As an example of a human. The skeleton is HTML. After that if you put skin, then CSS. And brain is put. The nervous system is JavaScript. Now I will take you to phobes.com. As soon as you go to phobes.com. You see a website is opened here. And phobes.com is a website. Which is HTML, CSS, JavaScript. It is like a website. If I click on right click, then it opens. Now you see here. They have used script in the head. And to add CSS. They have used link. So I will remove their CSS. So to remove CSS. I will clear all their style tags. By using delete key. So as soon as I remove all the CSS. I will clear all the CSS. I will clear all the CSS. I will clear all the CSS. By using delete key. So as soon as I remove all the style tags. And as soon as I remove all the link tags. So as soon as I have read all their style sheets. See what the condition of this page is. This page is showing something like this. It is only raw HTML. What size should be. What kind of images should be. They have forgotten all this. And only raw HTML is written here. Which is not styled at all. So the condition of phobes.com is something like this. Without CSS. It is showing something like this. And similarly. I can remove the script accent. Without JavaScript. Now if I delete the HTML tag of this page. Like this. I have deleted all the head. I have deleted all of this. So this is a blank page. Without HTML. So this is the role of HTML CSS and JavaScript. I want to tell you this course was initially made to be paid. But I changed my mood. And converted it to free course. I thought I will put it on YouTube. So I want you all to be serious. Many people have also reached out to launch paid course. To launch paid course. But I was getting a voice from my heart. I should keep this course free. Because when I learnt web development. I can understand that when you don't have a course to learn well. And you don't have the affordability to buy a paid course. So I can understand. And I decided that this course is for web development. It should be launched absolutely free. This course is free. But this free plan is like this. I will earn crores in a short time. You all will give me tea, coffee, parties and all the fees. This is our agreement in this video. So when you start earning crores. And you start earning lakhs. Then send me a green leaf. Or a red leaf. But you have to accept when you start earning well. Only after you start earning good. So I will tell you in the next video. How can you earn money by completing this course. I will put light on this. This is also an important day. How will you earn money. I will also do free lensing. How clients come. I will tell you everything. I want to tell you some action items.
