    "text": " In this video, we will learn about the forms and what is the input tag in the form. Forms are an important element of websites because you submit data through the form from client to server. These are the forms that you see on the contact pages, on Google forms or inquiry forms. On the flight or railway ticket, you submit all the details through the HTML forms. In the last video, many people liked it. I will request you to like this video with high energy so that we can maintain high energy throughout the course. So, let's go to the computer screen and see the forms, input tags and some best practices. Let's roll the intro. So guys, I have come to the computer screen. And now, I am going to make a folder here. The name of the folder is Video6. Because this is a 6th video. I will download it and open it with code. I have already told you all this. And here, I am going to make index.html. And by putting the exclamation mark on it, I will do the view, wrap, screen, mode, and you see here, I will write forms. Let's learn it. So, I have set the title of the form page here. And what happened by setting the title is that the title will be shown on our page. Here, I want to tell you about a very important setting, the show preview. People in the bar have also pointed out to me that you have to click so many times. So, can you do something? Yes, you can. Here, you click on the gear, click on the settings. And after clicking on the settings, what you do simply is, write here, live preview, live preview. And we can actually set it. When we click on it, what will happen is that it will open on the external browser. So, now, I will close everything. As soon as I click here, it will open on the external browser. And I come to the browser. And the playlists of Sigma Web Development, the playlists are definitely on iX, click on the star. And here, on the bookmark. But now, I want to tell you that as soon as we click here, it opens. So, if you want, do it like this. But sometimes, you want to prefer side by side view. And you want to do that when you are actually using HTML, CSS, or working on design. So, whenever you are working on design, you definitely want to see the live preview here. Which is why this extension was made. And it was made differently from the live server. That's why it will be seen in the side view. Now, what will we do here? We will go about forms. What is form? You know the name of form. It means the form of the railway. We fill it and it gets our reservation. Along with that, we fill the form of IEDJ, the form of need. We fill any form of the exam. So that we can reach our data to the person who wants it. So, this is form. HTML is a form tag. So, you will write form. You will enter. So, the first question will be about your form. Get or post? I will tell you a very quick difference between get request and post request. I will tell you the difference between get request and post request. Get request is a very simple request. And post request is sent to most of the cases when we have to give a lot of data. Whenever we have to give a form, we will use post request in most of the cases. And what is get request? It is a very simple request. We just have to tell the server and that's it. Or we have to hit the server with a request. But if you don't understand this, that should be fine. There is no problem. We will do this in detail. So, form action is equal to post. I wrote it here. Now, I can show you some input tags. I will tell you the input tags. What are the elements inside your form? Like you can put a date, you can put it in form. You can put your name, phone number, age, etc. You can put these things in form. So, I want to tell you that you put input tags in form. And a label tag which is used to label that input. So, what I will do here is, the simplest input tag is type is equal to text. So, I will put type is equal to text input here. And if I zoom out here, So, type is equal to text name is equal to user name. Place will enter user name. And this will actually change something. You can say enter your user name here. And the user name in front of you, you have to enter the user name. I will write an h1 here. And I will write here. Malo form to apply for ta for sigma web dev ta. Sigma web development codes ta. Malo, we are hiring teaching assistants for sigma web development codes. So, we can write something here. By the way, I have put subtitles. If you haven't done playlist, then do access it. And along with that, I will show you something else. The subtitles are quite funny. You can write on sigma badge and you can play village land. I mean, if you are watching a young race, or if you are watching a person who doesn't know Hindi at all, you can say, it's okay to go here and give your village land to me. So, you can see this. Anyway, you can see here that I have put the h1 here. Because it is our main heading. Enter your user name. This is our input tag. Along with input tag, we use the label tag. Now, whose label is this? I will write its id in 4 is equal to. Malo, I will write its id username. And what will I do in 4 is equal to? I will put it in 4 is equal to its id. Now, what is id here? I will tell you this later. For now, you just have to understand that this element has a unique identifier. To identify this element uniquely, your id number cannot be of any other kind. Similarly, this id username can't be found by anyone else. This is the id. I will tell you more in detail. Consider it as big. So, I have written label 4 is equal to username. I have written input here. And you can see here that the label will come here. So, I am looking here. I didn't put anything in the label. So, I will put enter your username. And you can see here, as soon as I put this, you will get to see enter your username. After that, you can enter your username here. And you can also enter your expertise here. Consider me asking here what is your gender. So, I can do something like this here. And you see, enter your gender. And as soon as I did this, I can ask you from the male or female. What is it? Now, what happens here is that sometimes we wrap it in div. What is div? Div is our block element. Okay. And what are the inline block elements? I haven't told you this in this course yet. But I will tell you in the coming videos. So, for now, you just have to understand this. I am putting this in div to give you a new space. Okay. So, as soon as I put this in div, it will come to the new space. Yes, there is a br tag too. Okay, br tag is also there, which is the inline block element. But I don't prefer br tag. And you will get to know why. Why we don't want to bloat our HTML from br tag. You will get to know this in the coming videos. Now, you see here, enter your username, here, male or female. Now, here, as soon as I am clicking on female, this radio button is selected. I am clicking on male, it is selected. Why is this happening? Because the label of this, I have equaled female for it and add ID female here. And along with that, I have put the name of these two. Because the name is equal to gender, I have also added this input tag. And the name is equal to gender, I have also added this input radio tag. And the type is equal to radio, this means that the radio button is there. And if we have same the name, then only one of the two can be selected at a time. If I have selected this, then it will be this. Now, I will show you one thing. If I put the ID in the form of the label, then it will be better. and i don't do it wrong in the first one, i do it wrong in the second one so when i click on the second female, it won't be selected, i am clicking on it and it won't be selected i am clicking on the male and it is selected, so to select the female i have to click on this here see, so i have to do it, always add the input tag ID of 4 is equal to so you can see here i have added the label 4 is equal to female with that we have an input tag which type is equal to checkbox here if i add the input of type is equal to checkbox i will add it in the div and right click on it and i will do it as i will do it our document will be very good, i.e. the formatting of it will be very good now see here, here subscribe to newsletter, here i can check it and the difference between the radio button and the checkbox is that you can check the checkbox or the different checkbox, here if you want you can select one of the male or female options so you can select it like this after this we have the text area and the select tag and i will show you that too so text area and select tag works like this, here copy text area and i will show you here, actually text area so text area input type is equal to text but in this it has rows and column attributes which helps you to reduce the size of it now see here, the placeholder i have given here enter your comment here, so i have given the text here ideally we will keep it empty or at least we will not give it a new line here, so i will hide it here enter your comment here and now it will reach to the left side so it has reached to the left side, see enter your comment here and here any user can put their comment now see the content of text area is entered here so ideally you don't want to keep text area empty and you want to put a label and you can say label for is equal to comment and we will definitely add id here whenever we add for, so it is in for the element that has its id now see here, enter your comment here so what will happen, enter your comment here so enter your comment here now if you want, this is not styled properly so this is not styled properly because we will style it with CSS later for now i will just put br tag but i don't recommend br tag i am telling you again, i don't recommend br tag because br tag is a problem you should know br tag is a line break tag so now you are thinking everything is fine what is the problem in br tag but i will tell you br tag is something that i don't recommend this is not to be used but i don't recommend using it all the time what happens is, it is the easiest thing for people to use br tag and add new spaces i will post a lot of this so i will copy it and show you the select tag something like this and you see here, as soon as i put select tag here i put it in div so what is in select that you get some options select is something like this make apple and you can use one of the three in cherry now you see here, any of the three can be used and here i did what, value is equal to apple first i made select tag name is equal to fruits then option value is equal to apple option value is equal to banana option value is equal to cherry when we pass this form data then i will tell you in javascript part how to send this data to the server so there are many things about form so stay tuned for that this was about forms i will tell you all the elements of form in this video and along with that i have told you all the select tag about form, the other attributes i have told you the action you can submit the form on any page from the action where will you handle the form you can give that data here then method is get request or post request i will tell you the difference in these two videos but i have told you in a very rough way that get request is a very simple request post request is used only when the server has to send a lot of data because the limit of get request is in post request you can send a lot of data okay, we don't even send passwords in get request we send it along with the post request okay, now here i have told you the method what is the name name is equal to user name means we mark it with name if we mark it with name then the server will know what is the corresponding value of key so the key value pair that will go to the server will go according to the name its name and value will go okay so we will see this when we do server side processing what is placeholder placeholder means what will be written in it like here entry and username is placeholder if i click on this then entry and username is not written in it i will write anything, see this is it but entry and username is just telling me here that i have to put username in it then what is required after this means you have to require it you have to put it, the value will have to be there otherwise your form will not submit so we will use this a lot then after this we have auto focus what auto focus does auto focus automatically focuses the cursor so i will show you the magic of auto focus so if you have written here input tag in it then auto focus okay so i have written auto focus in the entry and username now i will reload it so you see i will type it automatically it will focus on it okay so auto focus is done that whenever you type it will type here okay i hope you understand what i am saying now validation attribute here i have told you the requirement you can give a pattern in which you can give a regular expression pattern now you people do not get confused you do not say this is it what are you saying you do not get any regular expression so that is why i am sitting here i will teach you all things so you understand that we will accept a particular pattern if we put the pattern equal to this then you cannot put other than this pattern okay so you should know this here so i hope you are enjoying this video and along with that in the comment section write sigma batch op and give it and in the first video please review this course because still a lot of people ask me that should i do this course or not free course is free so people do not value it they say this course is free so we should watch it or take a paid course and i would like to give a note for them too who told me that we took a paid course what should we do now take the money or join sigma batch you all join sigma batch cut your losses and join sigma batch because look what quality of this course is i do not think you need to tell me so you all come and do it you all are going to meet here i am telling you free means i understand that in this course you all were going to sell 10,000 rupees yes that was the amount we fixed i was going to sell 10,000 rupees for this course and i think there is nothing wrong in selling any course if anyone is selling there is nothing wrong in selling any course but the thing is if you bought another course and you still feel that sigma batch is a very good course so you should join cut your losses and join because if you make your career once then in the future you all will not find anything like this if you look back in the
