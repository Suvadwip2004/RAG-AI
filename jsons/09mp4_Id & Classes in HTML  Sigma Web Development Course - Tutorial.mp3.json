The concept of ID and classes is one of the concepts that are confused. In fact, when I was learning HTML in my early days, I was confused in the ID and classes. ID means unique identifier. If you give an ID to an element, you will not give it to another element. But the meaning of the class is that if you want to give multiple elements to a property, you will give it multiple classes. For example, you can give a class called red, a div, and a form. Similarly, you can give an article tag or header tag for the class called bg red. Do like this video because we will go into the computer screen and we will see these things very closely. Let's roll the intro. I am back and if you have not accessed the Sigma Web Development course, then access the playlist. Click here and save the bookmark. The source code is also being uploaded on GitHub. I will come here in the folder and make a folder of video number 9. I will make a folder of video number 9 and after making a folder of video number 9, I will click shift and open it. You can see that this code is open in BS code. I will write index.html here and enter the exclamation mark. Now I will tell you what are the ID and classes. You will have a basic card or not? If you do not have any ID, then you will have no ID. Do not write in the comment that I do not have ID. If you go to any place, then you have to show ID. In some of the cases, to prove your identity. I am here. Now if you want to understand ID and classes in the restaurant, then the ID is your identity. So listen to the story here. This is John and this is Harry. They are very good friends. They are very good friends. They do not share their lunch and the rest are very good friends. They do not share their lunch and the rest are friends. Now you can see that John and Harry have their own ID. So this is my ID and John's ID looks like this. So this is John's ID and this is my ID. Both of us have the same ID. If you consider that our friend is my friend, Tania and John's friend is Shruti. So their ID will be different. This is Tania's ID. This is Tania's ID. This ID will be different for every person. John and Harry were friends. John's ID is Shruti's ID. This is Tania's ID. None of these 4 have the same ID. If you consider that we have the same ID, you will understand that we have the same ID. If I say that Shruti will be different for everyone, and if I say that Tania will be different for everyone, then you will understand that we have the same ID. So this ID will be unique for Tania, Harry, Shruti and John. So this is their ID. This ID will not be found by anyone else. Also, John and Harry were friends. They were in the same class. And the name of the class was class 10th. Both of them are in the class 10th. So consider that. And Shruti is in the class 9th. And Tania is in the class 9th. Both of them are in the class 9th. Tania is in the class 9th and Shruti is in the class 9th. So what is the class of Shruti? It can be 9th class. Shruti will have to study in this class. Or Harry will have to study in the class 10th. And children also have to study in the class. So the class means that Harry and John are in the class 1. So can a person have multiple classes? A person can have multiple classes. For example, Harry is in the class 10th. And he goes to a tuition where this class is in class 10A. Even in the class 10A, there are classes in the class. So there can be more than one class. One is in class 10A. And one is in class 10A. And along with that, if you wear Harry's red t-shirt, then it has a class red too. So the class doesn't mean that it is going to study. It means that it has been classified in this class. Now come here. Leave John and Harry Shruti. Delete this. I will zoom out and delete it. Now come to index.htm and understand this. I have made a div here. And I have given it a class red. And I have made a span. And I have given it a class red. I can give different elements to the classes I have given. Or I can give the same class. But if I want to add an id in any element. Suppose I have added an id in the first div. I can add anything in the id. So I don't give this id to any other element. Because this is the basis of this element. If that other div is also there, then I can't add it. Even then I will have to add something else. I have added the second div. I will write the second and first. So this concept of id and classes. I personally don't know. I understood it very late. When I was learning web development in my early days. I didn't know that id unilkly identifies an element. And the class that is there. It can add multiple classes in one element. And it can add one class in multiple elements. You understand. For example, if I have given it a red class. I can give it a bg yellow class. Okay bg yellow. I can give it a class. And if we give a class in multiple elements. Then we can add a space. For example, if I want to add multiple classes in this element. Then what will I do? I will write red here. Then I will write bg yellow. So in this way I can add multiple classes in the same element. Can I give the same element a multiple id? Do you ever want to give someone 2,000 cards? I don't know if there is anyone who makes it. But it doesn't matter. Adhar card is not there. Adhar number is one person's one. And Adhar number is not the same as a different person. Okay. One person can't have multiple. Different people can't have the same. But the class. If I say that you wear a t-shirt. Or you can wear a red t-shirt. It doesn't matter. If you go on the road. And if you like mangoes or bananas. Or if you like grapes. You will get multiple people. So consider that in banana class. Or they are in grapes class. In mango class. So we can classify in one class. And we can give one class to different elements. So I hope you understood this. Now I will write some CSS here. And don't say that you are not studying CSS. What am I writing in CSS? You can understand it. I am writing some alien language. Okay. In style.css. But I am trying to make a point. I will click here. And here its preview is looking like this. First or second. I will show you one thing. I am a class. How do you target in CSS? We will make a dot. Dot red means red class. And hash first div means. Hash means ID. Dot means class. Okay. If I say that first div is. Color the background color red. Okay. So first div color background red. Its background color will be red. Okay. These are the selectors in CSS. And now I don't want to confuse you. And I can comment like this in CSS. Okay. But we will have to read all these things. Now I will write dot red. And here I will write background color red. And also I will write dot bg yellow. Dot bg yellow is my point. I have to write dot. Dot means class. It means class bg yellow. And I will write background color yellow. Sorry. I will write color red. I will not write background color red. Dot red means color red. Look. Its color red and background color yellow. So in this way you can use ID and classes in CSS. I hope you have understood something. Now one thing to note here. What is really important is that The ID and classes are attributes of the element. This is ID attribute and this is class attribute. So what are the ID classes? Are they elements or not? They are the attributes of the elements. Now one more use of ID. I will tell you what is the use of ID. If I take you to Wikipedia and write the coding. So this page of Wikipedia. I will go to some other page on some other page. So you see that when you go to any page on Wikipedia. So what can you do? You can take the link of that particular place. I will show you how it works. I will go to some other page. I will scroll down. And here I will inspect the ID of this page. This is the ID of this page. So I will copy this in this ID. And if I put here the hashtag and this ID. Now I will enter. So it will directly take me here. In ICDA 8. So if I put this in incognito. It will scroll me and show that particular ID. Look. It scrolls me and instead of showing me this. It scrolls me and shows me. Because it wants to take me to this ID. So it works in linking. So it is an ID. You will know that many people will know that. You can generate links. You can write any link with the hashtag. If you open that link. Then you will see the same ID. Like I am giving in this case. You can see that as soon as I am entering. So maybe I have wronged the ID. But you got the point. You got the point. 29.29. And I will enter it. So look I have come down. I will open incognito. Or reload it. If I do that. Then you see I have come down. I will scroll it. And after that I will open the new tab. And if I do this. Look. It is taking me to the same page. This ID on which page. So I hope you have understood the ID and the classes. From the video. The ID means like the basic card. Class means like one person's property. Like he likes red. Or which class he is in. One element can be given multiple classes. One element can be red color. And its background can be yellow. And the other element can be red. And its background can be yellow. And red can be given multiple classes. You can put red class on a fake element. And you can put red class on an element. You can put yellow class on it. So I hope you have understood. So that's all for now. I was reading captions. And I laughed. I read captions. So I told him that the land of the village is mine. And I laughed 5-10 times. It was very tasty. I told him to access the name of the village. And mine. So on this. Access the playlist. Access the GitHub. Like the video. Keep it up. And comment down below. Write the hashtag sigma batch op in the comment section. Thank you so much for watching this video. And I will see you next time."}
