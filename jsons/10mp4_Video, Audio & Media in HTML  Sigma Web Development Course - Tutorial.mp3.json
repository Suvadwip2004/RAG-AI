    "text": " In this video, we will learn how to use audio, video and media elements in HTML. We have seen in our very first video that we can embed videos in HTML. Today, I will tell you how to play video auto. How to keep muted video and how to enable and disable the controls of video. Along with that, we will also see a lot of audio. How can media be shown in a page overall. Like this video and stay tuned because the examples I have used are very effective for video tags. Let's go to the middle screen. Let's roll the intro. I have made a folder called video 10 this time. I will not waste your time by opening and opening the code by right-clicking the shift. In fact, I will make it in the index.html. The topic of today's video is video. How to play video in an HTML file. How to add video. How to add audio. How to add media. So, adding video is very straightforward. I will copy it here. This is our video tag. It has an SRC attribute. And there are some other attributes about it that I will discuss with you. But first, I would like to tell you that video SRC is equal to this. So, if you have video.mp4, then it will be played. I have video.mp4. So, let's see. I have put it here with control. And I will click here and preview it. And you can see that this video is here. Now it is a very big video. So, what can I do to give its width? So, I can say that width is equal to 555 pixels. And as soon as I do 555 pixels, in fact, I do not need to write PX. I will just do 555. As soon as we do not need to write PX in the image. Here, we do not need to write PX. So, as soon as I do width is equal to 555. In fact, I do height is equal to 555. So, it becomes smaller. In fact, I do it smaller. I do 255. And you see, it came here. Okay, now I will play it. Because I have put control. I can play it. Look, there is a better route than America. I think. What is my name? Bobendra Jogi. Where have you been to in US? I have been to a lot of places in US. What is your name? Bobendra Jogi. So, you can play video like this. Now, some attributes are used here. This is video tag. It is very simple to use video tag. You should have a video. You have given the path of the video. You have written the controls. So, these controls will come. You can download it. You can do full screen. You can do mute. You can do picture in picture. All this automatically presents your browser. But, I will tell you some attributes. The first attribute is SRC. You must know that. Put the video here. The name of the video file is SRC. This video file can also come from the external URL. You understand? If I have uploaded another video on Amazon S3. I can also put the URL there. It is not necessary. The file can be on your server or third party. What do you do with the controls? Arts, video controls like play, pause and volume. We have seen it in Bobendra Jogi's video. You can see the controls here. Now, what is this? The browser automatically sees what is the control and what is not. Then, what will auto play? It will automatically play. Like the page load. So, if I put the auto play here. I will put auto play here. What do you see in the market? What is happening? How is it going here? It is good. You can see that this is auto play. I will remove the auto play from here. The next attribute is loop. Once our video is played. It will loop. Like I will show you. What do you see in the market? Bobendra Jogi. What do you see in the market? This is the start again. Once I finished this. This is the start again. This loop works like this. The next attribute is muted. Muted makes the video muted. So, if I write here muted. Sometimes we want the video to be muted. In fact, when I add videos here on codewithhari.com. And I demonstrate something. I am downloading VS Code. So, I use muted attribute. But I don't want that when I have recorded a video. If there is a background noise, they will tell you. For example, I want to show you that this is an element. So, I will make a video by scrolling like this. I will highlight it like this. So, I don't want the audio in it. So, I will mute it. So, you can use muted attribute in your websites. Then, poster. Poster is very important. So, I have an image here. Download.jpg If I write here, poster is equal to And I write download.jpg So, you will see something like this. This is how it looks. I will play it. So, the video will be played. So, it is a thumbnail. You can see the thumbnail of YouTube video. This is the poster attribute. So, you can use these attributes. You know that width and height Specifies the dimension of the video. Like I have seen both width and height. So, I hope you have understood this. Now, the thing I want to tell you is audio. So, this is the attribute of the video. It is very straightforward. I want you to make a website. Which I am going to give you at the end of this video. In quick quiz. So, do listen to the quick quiz. In fact, I will put a quick quiz from the heading. Okay. So, I will not forget. I will give you this. And this is going to be a very fun quiz. And everyone should solve it. But, before that. As you write audio, SRC comes here. And I am putting it in src.mp3. So, I will put it as src.mp3. Now, look here. I will reload it. And here, the audio is not here. Which is strange. Let me see what is the problem here. SRC is equal to many. I will have to write controls here. So, if I write with controls, I will not see audio. See, now the audio is here. See, I can set the volume of this audio. So, I will play this audio. What is Sachin in Sachin? It is not Sachin. Okay. So, this is our audio. If I mute it, it will not work. I can increase it even further. It is not Sachin. Okay. Now, you have seen it. So, this is the audio called Sachin.mp3. Now, what we will do is, We will see some attributes of this audio. SRC, you know that, source, video file. It will automatically play. If I play here, What is Sachin in Sachin? It will automatically play. So, if I play it, it will automatically play. This audio is ours. After this, the next attribute is loop. What will loop do? It will repeat it. If I want to loop it, I have played it. I will loop it. What is Sachin in Sachin? It is not Sachin. So, you have seen it. It was repeated. Then, it was again looped. Because I had looped the audio. So, you have seen it. Sachin.mp3 looped it. So, it was again looped. What is Sachin? It is repeatedly said. Because, this MP3 will play again and again. So, there are many other cases. When you want this MP3 to be repeated. Okay. So, if you want your MP3 to be repeated, You can use it. Now, after this, You can mute the audio. And definitely, you don't want Your audio to be muted in most of the cases. But, we sometimes want The audio to be muted. And we can say to the user Who wants to hear it and mute it. What is Sachin? We do this when we have multiple audios. You want to show 5-6 audios together. You can mute them. The user who wants to play and mute it. So, you can control it. If you want, you can use it. So, I hope you understood this. You must have enjoyed it. Now, preload. The most confusing attribute. That is why I have explained it in CodeWithRyote.com. Preload attribute. These values can be. The first value can be none. This is the default value. It indicates that the browser should not preload the audio at all. Preload means, If you want to fetch the data from the browser. Then, you will use the preload attribute. Otherwise, you won't use the preload attribute. Preload is equal to none. The default value is preload is equal to metadata. The browser will preload the audio information about metadata. Preload will be preloaded. And auto-load will preload the audio. Preload is equal to auto. If I do auto-load, it will be downloaded and automatically loaded. So that when the user plays, it will save the audio. So, preload attribute works. And in interviews, preload attribute is very popular. You should know what preload attribute is. Before moving ahead, I want you to share this playlist with your friends.

If I write here that I amg.svg and save SVG. You can see here that I didn't get to see this. If I write here mysvg image you can see that mysvg image came here. But I didn't get to see SVG. Why did this happen? Because SVG is written in the SVG file in browser. And you can see that if you want to see it. You can add a declaration. I have written here SVG file not showing. So, the answer of stack overflow which will tell you. So, you have to write this. Look at XML. You have to add this. It is called namespace declaration. So, you have to add this thing.
