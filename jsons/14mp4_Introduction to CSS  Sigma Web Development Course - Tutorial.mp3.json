We have gone far ahead in this course. We have finished the whole HTML. And many of you have shown a lot of enthusiasm. Don't decline your interest in this video. Like this video and write down the sigma batch op in the comments section with high energy. We are maintaining such high energy throughout the course. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. And we supplement HTML with some style with the help of Cascading Style Sheets. The HTML was never intended to create styled pages. That is, HTML's work was to create a basic website structure. And CSS takes responsibility to style the page. There are selectors in CSS who help select any element. I will tell you in this video what is a selector and how CSS is written. In the upcoming videos, we are going to raise the bar like anything. We will make real-world websites and such websites like Amazon, Flipkart, Netflix, YouTube, all these websites you can make. I am very excited. Let's go to the computer screen. Let's roll the intro. I have come to my computer screen. I will always make a folder here. And I will make a folder in the name of Video 14. It is very fun in this course. Because I have never made a course of this level. Now, I will tell you about CSS first. Why will you use CSS? HTML was never intended to style web pages. HTML was always intended to create a skeleton. There were many tags in HTML that were deprecated like font tag. Because HTML was responsible for creating a skeleton website. That's about it. After that, the work was to handle all the CSS. In this video, we will make real-world websites. If you haven't done the playlist, you can do that too. The source code is coming here. Codewithherry.com. If you go to the notes, you can download the HTML notes. You will get additional things to see. So, as soon as you click on the PDF notes, you will get the PDF notes of HTML. This is written by me in my handwriting. Handwritten in notes. It is written in a very hard way. So, you can download it. I will put the link in the description. I had told you that if the HTML is the body of a car, i.e. the car's roof, then CSS is the paint, decoration, designs, seeds, interior, all these things. And JavaScript is Engine and Internal Logic. Anyway, we will talk about Engine and Internal Logic later. We have completed the HTML. We are talking about CSS. Now, I will tell you some more examples. Like your human body. There is a skeleton in the human body. You can consider the skeleton as HTML. Skin, hair, You can consider all this as CSS. And the brain, nerves, neurons, all of that constitutes JavaScript. So, I hope this thing is clear to you. So, by combining the tools, HTML was never intended to style websites. This responsibility was taken by CSS. CSS said, HTML is enough for you. Now, I am here. And now, I will help you in styling. So, CSS took responsibility to style the pages. So, download the HTML notes. Anyway, spoiler alert. The CSS notes are also very sharp. But listen to me first. I have given you the spoiler. But don't download it now. I took a lot of time and took it with great effort. So, there are many things to be found. And I have never made a course of this level. So, if I click Shift and click open with code, then this video 14 folder is opened in my VS code. Now, I have made an HTML file. And by clicking the exclamation mark, I have made a boilerplate code. As we were doing our HTML course. We should do it like the HTML videos. And I will write CSS in the title. And consider me as a div in the body. Hey, I am Harry. And today, I am in CSS mode. Okay, I have written it. And I will preview it. So, as soon as I click on preview, you can see that I am Harry. And today, I am in CSS mode. So, what is CSS? You can add CSS by using style tag. There are two more ways. I will tell you in the upcoming videos. I will tell you a lot of things. Now, if I say that the div is, the color of the div is red. I said that the color of the div is red. So, the div in the div is selector. And this is our declaration. So, selector and declaration. The selector is div. That is, the color of all the divs of this page. Which is our key, value, property. This is the value of that property. Red the color. So, this is our declaration. And this is our selector. I hope you understood. So, here, if I show you the page, then see if its color is red. Because I said that whatever div is in this page, color it red. So, if I make another div here. And write, I am good. So, that I am good color will also be ready. As you can see. And if I put another declaration in this. And I write here, background yellow. So, here, its background is also yellow. Its background is also yellow. Whatever the selector matches, that element's background will be yellow. Like you see here, I said div. And here, this was the div. And here, this was the div. If I make a span here. And I write here, I am also good. So, what will happen? Will this also be red? No, its color will not be red. Because this selector. And these declarations are not applicable on these elements. Okay. Any element which is not div. Okay. If I put a paragraph here. And put loram 435 in this. Oops. I think 435 is too much. 43 is enough. Okay. I have put a very big loram here. Because it will make our page very big. So, this declaration was not applicable in this. It was not applicable in this too. I had only said div. So, all these conditions applied in div. Now, you can select multiple elements by putting comma here. I can say, do this in divorce pan. So, divorce pan will be red in both. And here, background color will be yellow. Divor spin is my selector. So, I have applied these declarations in multiple selector. This is property. Background color is a property. Its value is yellow. Color is a property. Its value is red. Okay. You can see here. Wherever there is div. Wherever there is span. This thing will be applied there. And that's pretty much how CSS works. That's it. What we are learning in the coming videos. This is from property. And this is from selector. I will tell you about different selectors. That's about it. It's as simple as that. And using these selectors, we can make a website like Amazon. We can make a website like Flipkart. We can make a website like Facebook. And an Instagram like website. We can make all of these. And nowadays, there are such technologies in the market. You can make mobile apps by coding like this. We will explore all of these things. It will be a very extensive course. It will be fun. We will be touching so many things. I gave you guys an exercise video number 12. If you haven't posted your answer, then quickly post your answer. Because I will give you a shout out. The comment section will post their answer. Make sure you go to video 12. Solve the pure HTML, player exercises. Because there will be two interactions. It will be fun. We will talk from both sides. I will give you a shout out. You will solve it. So do solve it. I want to tell you about the replete. Many people say that we don't have a laptop. Many people have problems. So replete is an amazing platform. You can try it out. You just have to sign up here. And you will be able to write HTML, CSN, JavaScript. And it works very well. I have used it for my production and great projects. And I have made a lot of videos on replete on this channel. We have done 100 days of code in replete. You can use it. If you don't have a laptop, you can use it. You can do it. It will be a great experience. So write in the comment section below. Tell me if it is fun or not. Because I want everyone to comment. In the comment section below. That it is fun. Do access this playlist. Access the source code. I have updated the source code of all the videos. And name the land of both the villages. That is all for now. Thank you so much for watching this video. And I will see you next time. Bye."}
