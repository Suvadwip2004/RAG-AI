The **`<h1>` tag** is the most important heading element in HTML. It marks the main title of a page or a section, and search engines use it to understand the primary topic.

#### How to find it

1. **Video 4 – “Heading, Paragraphs and Links”**  
   - Go to the video.  
   - Jump to about **2 :35 (155 s)** and watch a few seconds.  
   - Continue to **2:39 (159.8 s)** for a more detailed walkthrough of `<h1>`.

2. If you want a deeper dive on how `<h1>` fits with other tags, check **Video 13 – “Entities, Code tag and more on HTML”** at the timestamps listed above.

Feel free to pause, rewind, and take notes—especially on the syntax and when to use `<h1>` versus other heading levels (`<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc.). The course emphasizes that the first `<h1>` on a page is typically the main title and should be used sparingly for clarity.
